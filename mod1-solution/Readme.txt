This is the solution for the first week assignment.
It includes all the bonus:
If the message is "Enjoy!" or "Too much!", make the font color green. If the message is "Please enter data first", make the font color red.
If the message is "Enjoy!" or "Too much!", make the border color around the textbox green. If the message is "Please enter data first", make the border color around the textbox red.
Implement this case item 1, item2,,item3 or this case item 1, item2, ,item3 as not counting an 'empty' item towards the count of how many items there are in the list. Please make sure to put a comment somewhere next to the input textbox stating that you do NOT consider and empty item, i.e., , , as an item towards to the count, so whoever is grading your assignment doesn't erroneously mark that as an error.
